TravelEase, a growing travel-tech startup offering online flight booking and payment services, 
struggles to coordinate independent teams as they each update their own microservice—
deploying new features or fixes often involves manual coordination, inconsistent 
environments, and service outages that frustrate both customers and developers. 

To overcome these challenges, TravelEase needs a fully automated end-to-end deployment 
pipeline that can package and version each microservice independently, run automated tests 
and validations before updates are released, manage seamless, zero-downtime rollouts of
individual services, ensure consistent environments across development, staging, and 
production, enable independent scaling of services to handle variable traffic (e.g., holiday 
travel spikes), and provide real-time visibility into service health and performance—allowing 
teams to innovate rapidly without risking reliability or customer experience.

Key Features  
• Single repository for collaboration: All microservices are managed in one GitHub 
repo using feature branches and pull requests. 
• Containerization: Each service is packaged using Docker for consistency. 
• AWS Deployment: Services are deployed on AWS ECS or EC2 using Terraform. 
• CI/CD Pipelines: Jenkins automates the build, tagging, pushing to ECR, and 
deployment process. 
• Service Connectivity: Services communicate via AWS Load Balancers and ECS 
Service Discovery. 
• Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus tracks metrics, Grafana visualizes data, and 
CloudWatch aggregates logs and sends alerts.
